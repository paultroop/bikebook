Any comments, queries, or feedback is welcome. 2.1 Introduction This chapter is about public rights of way usable by cyclists, in particular bridleways. In summary, under civil law, cyclists have the right to use bridleways, but not footpaths.1 If a cyclist rides on a footpath, they commit the civil tort of trespass and can be sued by the highways authority.2 Older authorities suggest the owner of the subsoil could also sue,3 but these predate the authorities that confirm that it is the highway authority that owns the freehold right to the surface and foundations of the highway (see further 2.3) and at least one eminent commentator has doubted the right of the owner of the subsoil to sue a highway user in trespass.4 By contrast, cycling on a footpath is not generally a criminal or road traffic offence without specific provision. When exercising their right to use a bridleway, cyclists must give way to pedestrians and horseback riders.5 In addition, there are procedures to require highways authorities to maintain highways including paths used by cyclists. See further section 2.6.1 below. Bridleways are potentially very useful cycling connections, given that they often connect towns and villages which are otherwise only connected by motor vehicle carriageways where the speed limit is 60mph, making them unsuitable for cycling. Most highways authorities maintain a map of public rights of way. For example Oxfordshire’s is listed here. However, where the highway authority has a duty to maintain bridleways for walking and horseriding, they are not obliged to do so for cycling6 7. In addition to budget constraints, this means that the maintenance of bridleways in a way that would be suitable for cycling depends on the outlook of the particular highway authority. Most bridleways are maintainable at public expense. Maintenance of bridleways needs to be distinguished from improvement. The highways authority has the right to maintain bridleways [Query whether landowner has to object to improvements]. 2.2 Definitions Important definitions are included in the Highways Act 1980.8 In particular: “bridleway” means a highway over which the public have the following, but no other, rights of way, that is to say, a right of way on foot and a right of way on horseback or leading a horse, with or without a right to drive animals of any description along the highway; Note that notwithstanding the definition of bridleway in the Highways Act 1980,9 cyclists have the right to use bridleways under the Countryside Act 1968.10 A restritcted byway is defined by CRWA 2000 as a right of way on foot, horse, or non-mechanically propelled vehicles (such as cycles).11 Restricted byways were introduced in 200012 to replace a previous category of highway called a ‘road used as a public path’ which were introduced in 1949.13 2.3 Ownership of the Highway by the Highway Authority As one notable publication has observed, one of the most difficult things to accept from a landowner’s point of view is that the surface and foundations of a publicly maintainable right of way belong to the highway authority.14 Every highway surface, including the materials and scrapings (debris and by-products of highway resurfacing) belongs to the highway authority15 as a determinable ‘fee simple absolute in possession’.16 Above the surface, ownership has been said to include such a section of the air above the surface as is necessary for the discharge of the highway authority’s duties.17 Below the surface, ownership has been said to include as much depth as is necessary to support the surface of the road18 or the ‘top two spits’ (a spit is the depth of the blade of a spade).19 As such, a highway authority may not excavate far below the highway for non-highway purposes such as the construction of public toilets.20 2.3.1 Minimum Widths Minimum and maximum widths of highways are set by the HA 1980.21 For a bridleway, the minimum width of a cross-field path is 2m and a field-edge path is 3m.22 The maximum width is 3m.23 The corresponding minimum widths for footpaths are half this: 1m for cross-field paths and 1.5m for field-edge paths.24 The maximum width of a footpath is 1.8m.25 2.4 Publically Maintainable The burden is on a highway authority to prove that a highway is not maintainable by them.26 There is some evidence that highways authorities take the view that it is less expensive to assume that highways are publicly maintainable than to question the point.27 2.5 Duty to Maintain The highway authority has the duty to maintain highways.28 The duty to maintain includes the surface29 and the drains beneath or beyond the traffic surface.30 The concept of ‘maintenance’ includes ‘repair’.31 In the case of Hereford &amp; Worcester CC v Newman,32 it was held that to be out of repair, the surface of the highway needed to be defective or disturbed in some way. Thus vegetation growing on the surface of a footpath making it difficult to navigate rendered it out of repair, but a multi-stranded barbed wire fence above the surface of the footpath did not. [Given the recognition that ownership of a highway includes such of the subtrata and the space above the surface that is necessary to discharge the highway authority’s duties in addition to just the surface and that maintenance includes the drains beneath the traffic surface, this decision seems surprising and may well have been wrongly decided (MacKenna J dissented in that case).] Note that this case does not necessarily introduce a lacuna for obstructions because there are separate provisions authorising the highways authority to deal with obstructions on the highway. See further section 2.7. Though the primary obligation to maintain highways falls on the highway authority, district councils have the power to maintain certain highways33 which include bridleways and restricted byways.34 Where this happens, the highways authority is obliged to compensate the district council for any expenses incurred.35 2.6 Standard of Maintenance by the Highway Authority [CHECK WESTLAW ENCYCLOPEDIA OF HIGHWAY LAW AND PRACTICE] There are no statutory guidelines for the standards required to maintain bridleways.36 However, under common-law, a highway authority liable to maintain a highway is required to keep the road in a state of repair so as to be reasonably passable for the ordinary traffic of the neighbourhood for all seasons of the year37 38.39 It is not a defence to failure to maintain for the highways authority to say that its resources were insufficient.40 Similarly to the provisions regarding bridleways contained in the CA 1968,41 on ‘restricted byways’ (highways with rights of way on foot, horseback, or non-mechanically propelled vehicles),42 highways authorities are not required to provide a ‘metalled’ or other ‘bound’ surface (eg asphalt, concrete, or clay pavers / bricks) suitable for cycling.43 Other common-law guidance regarding maintenance is provided in the context of personal injury actions against highway authorities44 4546 47, but these are primarily focussed on the issue of whether the danger posed by the highway is reasonably foreseeable rather than whether the highway is reasonably passable so may not be entirely relevant. Also, all of these cases are in the context of urban highways rather than rural highways where the standard of maintenance is generally accepted to be lower because defects in country highways are more probable and therefore more foreseeable. There are also few reported cases of personal injury actions where a user has been injured by an unsafe rural footpath or bridleway. [An interesting question arises as to whether highways authorities would be liable to an injured cyclist if a bridleway was foreseeably dangerous, given the lack of a statutory obligation to make highways suitable for cycling under the CA 196848 and the CRWA 200049 ]. 2.6.1 Complaints of Failure to Repair There is a procedure to enforce the highway authority’s duty to repair highways which may be used in relation to either urban or rural highways. A complainant serves a notice on the highway authority asking it to confirm that the way is a highway and that the highway authority is liable to repair it50 [A precedent may be helpful here]. If the highway authority does not reply or admit this is so within one month, the complainant may seek an order from the Crown Court ordering the highway authority to repair the highway.51 If the highway authority does admit this, then the complainant has 6 months to apply to the Magistrates’ Court for an order that the highway authority repair the highway.52 In some circumstances the complainant can secure the Magistrates’ Court’s permission to undertake the repairs himself53 and recover the costs of so doing from the highway authority.54 2.6.2 Damages for Breach of Duty A person injured by the failure of a highways authority to maintain a highway may bring an action in tort for damages for breach of the the statutory duty contained in the HA 1980.55 The highway authority has a defence if it can show that it had taken such care in all the circumstances as was reasonably required to ensure that the highway was not dangerous for traffic.56 2.7 Obstructions ***‘No civil cause of action arises under s 150; the remedy for breach lies in a complaint to the magistrates’ court, which has the power to order removal of any obstruction on the highway (s 150(2)). By virtue of the fact that a specific and separate duty arises under s 150 to remove debris/obstructions on the Highway, the Court of Appeal has held that such a duty is not encapsulated within s 41. That duty relates to the fabric of the highway alone see Valentine v Transport for London and another [2010] EWCA Civ 1358, at para 12.’57 2.8 Remedies for Damage caused by Third Parties A highways authority has a statutory right to seek damages against third parties where expenses have been incurred maintaining the highway by reason of damage caused by excessive weight passing along the highway or due to other ‘extraordinary traffic’.58 Extraordinary traffic has been described as quality or quantity of articles carried or mode or time of use that substantially alters and increases the burden imposed by ordinary traffic on the road, causing additional damage and expenses.59 In the context of bridleways, such damage might be caused by motorbikes, quadbikes, or motorised vehicles. 2.9 Obligations of Neighbouring Landowners Some footpaths and bridleways cross agricultural fields rather than going around the edges. A cross-field path may only be ploughed or disturbed if it is not reasonably convenient to avoid the path.60 Where this happens, the landowner must make good the surface of the path or way and indicate its line on the ground.61 This must be done within 14 days where it is the first sowing of a particular crop and 24 hours in any other case.62 This time can be extended by the highway authority for up to 28 days.63 Failure by the landowner to comply is a criminal offence giving rise to a fine.64 Landowners are also required to ensure that the line on the ground of a highway is indicated so that it is apparent to members of the public wishing to use it and that their crops do not encroach on the highway.65 Failure to do so is also a criminal offence.66 A highway authority can also require owners and occupiers of neighbouring land whose trees, shrubs, or hedges overhang a highway so as to endanger or obstruct pedestrians or horseriders to cut it so as to remove the issue67 68. Thus vegetation on bridleways that endangers cyclists can be required to be removed. The HA 1980 sets out a number of offences that might be commmitted by a landlowner, such as removing soil or turf from a highway[HA1980, s.131], willfully obstructing free passage along the highway[HA1980, s.137], depositing things on the highway to the interruption of a user[HA1980, s.148], to resulting in a highway user being injured or endangered[HA1980, s.161]. 2.10 Improvements Powers to make improvements HA1980 s. 62 et seq 2.11 Planning permission Works required for the maintenance or improvement of a road carried out within the boundaries of the road do not amount to development and do not require planning consent [‘Town and Country Planning Act 1990’69 s. 55(2)(b) References "],["cross.html", "Chapter 3 Cross-references 3.1 Chapters and sub-chapters 3.2 Captioned figures and tables", " Chapter 3 Cross-references Cross-references make it easier for your readers to find and link to elements in your book. 3.1 Chapters and sub-chapters There are two steps to cross-reference any heading: Label the heading: # Hello world {#nice-label}.
